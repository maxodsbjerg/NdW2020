# NdW2020
Repository for code used in the Online Code Along-Workshop in connection with the 2020 Nacht der Wissenschaft in Kiel. 

# Aim 
The aim of this online code along workshop is to introduce code based text mining to newcomers. This is done by letting attendes work directly with the methods and material themselves. In this workshop the material is text and metadata from the old newspaper Lyna(1797-1848) which was published in Haderslev/Hadersleben. This newspaper is used in this workshop due to it's language being a mix between Danish and German. In particular we will be working with the year 1847, which places the workshop in a historical setting amidst national identity formation, war and changing borders. 

# Data 
The dataset is as mentioned text from the newspaper Lyna. A few remarks should be mentioned on the genesis of this data. The old printed newspaper har of course be collected to an library back in the days. At some point the collected newspapers started filling up to much space in the libraries. This resulted in the photographing of the individual newspaperpages and following transferal to microfilm. Leafing through microfilm can however be abit cumbersome.  
This is why a digitisation process was started in 2014. The process encompassed amongst other things a proces of text recognition (called Optical Character Recognintion(OCR)) on the now digital copies of the photographed newspapers. This made it possibel to do free text searches throug a news paper, which was a great improvement compared to turning your self through a mikrofilm.  
This proces of OCR works very well on 'modern' characters, but has some limitations on the fonts used in newspapers in the 18th century, the so-called fraktur:
